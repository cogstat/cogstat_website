## Second Best Practices in Data Analysis and Statistics Symposium

(It is the second symposium, not the second best solutions.)

### About the symposium

__Venue__ Eötvös Loránd University, [Faculty of Education and Psychology](https://www.ppk.elte.hu/en), [Budapest, Kazinczy street, 23-27](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/E%C3%B6tv%C3%B6s+Lor%C3%A1nd+University+Faculty+of+Education+and+Psychology/@47.4974725,19.0570867,15.36z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1e0c4e20afde6337!8m2!3d47.4982569!4d19.0626694), (Room TBA).

__Date__ January 9, 2019

__Website__ [http://www.cogstat.org/best_practices_symposium/](http://www.cogstat.org/best_practices_symposium/)

__Aims__ While many new methods are developed these days that are applicable in behavioral sciences, many valuable older methods are not used, because they are not accessible, because researchers do not know how to use them, or because researchers do not even know about them. The aim of the Best practices symposium is to popularize either new or old solutions, to familiarize researchers with these methods, and to make these methods more accessible. In addition, the symposium is a great opportunity to discuss and evaluate various methods to improve research practice.

__Previous symposium__ Although we expect to see some changes compared to the last year’s symposium, to get an impression about the symposium see the last year’s program [here](2017/index.html).

### Call for abstracts

__Presentations__ Potential talks may include:
* Presentation of new methods, preferably also offering computational tools
* Presentation of older methods, that are hardly known among researchers
* Demonstration of software solutions that could make the analysis more efficient
* Presentation of tutorials that introduce either new or older methods

__Small group hands-on tutorials__ This year we introduce small group hands-on tutorials. Potential tutorials may be:
* 60-120 minutes long
* They may require participants to have their own computer with appropriate software installed on it
* Participants will register separately for the tutorial sessions

Deadline for abstract submission is December 2, 2018.
