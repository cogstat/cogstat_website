## Third Best Practices in Data Analysis and Statistics Symposium

(Again, it is the third symposium, not the third best solution.)

### About the symposium

__Venue__ University of Pécs, [Institute of Psychology](https://btk.pte.hu/en/institute-of-psychology), [Pécs, Ifjúság street, 6.](https://osm.org/go/0KHqHfaT8?m=), Building B.

__Date__ September 7-8, 2023

__Website__ [https://www.cogstat.org/best_practices_symposium/](https://www.cogstat.org/best_practices_symposium/)

__Aims__ While many new methods are developed these days that are applicable in behavioral sciences, many valuable older methods are not used, because they are not accessible, because researchers do not know how to use them, or because researchers do not even know about them. The aim of the Best practices symposium is to popularize either new or old solutions, to familiarize researchers with these methods, and to make these methods more accessible. In addition, the symposium is a great opportunity to discuss and evaluate various methods to improve research practice.

### Program, abstracts, and slides

__Program__
* September 7, 11:00 Presentations
* September 7, 19:00 Dinner and socializing

* Presentation of new methods, preferably also offering computational tools
