## Best practices in data analysis and statistics symposium


### About the symposium

__Venue__ Eötvös Loránd University, [Faculty of Education and Psychology](https://www.ppk.elte.hu/en), [Budapest, Kazinczy street, 23-27](https://www.google.hu/maps/@47.4981147,19.0627044,3a,75y,23.51h,86.1t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgm__OBazQlCGeiJqLtIDbw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656), Room 203.

__Date__ 17 November 2017, 12:00


__Aims__ While many new methods are developed these days, many valuable older methods are not used, because they are not accessible, because researchers do not know how to use them, or because researchers do not even know about them. The aim of the Best practice symposium is to popularize either new or old solutions, to familiarize researchers with these methods, and to make these methods more accessible.

__Presentations__ Potential talks may include:
* Presentation of new methods, preferably also offering computational tools
* Presentation of older methods, that are hardly known among researchers
* Demonstration of software solutions that could make the analysis more efficient
* Presentation of tutorials that introduce either new or older methods
