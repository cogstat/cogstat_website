## Fourth Best Approaches in Data Analysis and Statistics Symposium

(Again, it is the fourth symposium, not the fourth-best solution.)

### About the symposium

__Venue__ University of Szeged, [Institute of Psychology](https://www.pszich.u-szeged.hu/), [Szeged, Egyetem street 2, BTK building](https://osm.org/go/0KlyHIXRG?m=).

__Date__ September 5-6, 2024

__Website__ [https://www.cogstat.org/best_approaches_symposium/](https://www.cogstat.org/best_approaches_symposium/)

__Aims__ While many new methods are developed these days that are applicable in behavioral sciences, many valuable older methods are not used because they are not accessible, because researchers do not know how to use them, or because researchers do not even know about them. The aim of the Best Approaches symposium is to popularize either new or old solutions, familiarize researchers with these methods, and make these methods more accessible. In addition, the symposium is an excellent opportunity to discuss and evaluate various methods to improve research practice.

### Call for abstracts

__Presentations__ Potential talks on the first day may include:
* Presentation of new methods, preferably also offering computational tools
* Presentation of older methods that are less known among researchers
* Demonstration of software solutions that could make the analysis more efficient
* Presentation of tutorials that introduce either new or older methods

__Small group hands-on tutorials__ On the second day, small group hands-on tutorials can also be given. Potential tutorials may be:
* 60-120 minutes long
* They may require participants to have their own computer with appropriate software installed on it
* Participants will register separately for the tutorial sessions

__Submission__ Submit your abstract by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/54wKzPvpqG2JfoWe8).

__Deadline__ The deadline for abstract submission is July 23, 2023.
